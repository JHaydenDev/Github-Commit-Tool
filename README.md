# Github-Commit-Tool

I built this project as a take home test.  It utilizes the github API to monitor its own commit history.  To run this application your first will need to follow the following steps.

1: Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment
This is completely optional and not required for this tutorial!


Optional: Instructions for following along locally using your preferred text editor
This setup requires more work but allows you to complete the tutorial using an editor of your choice. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. You can find it here: https://nodejs.org/en/

2. A Code Editor installed (if you plan on changing anything).  I reccommend VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3. The latest version of Git installed. Here:https://git-scm.com/downloads

4.Clone the project via your terminal.  `git clone https://github.com/JHaydenDev/Github-Commit-Tool.git`

3. Now run `yarn start` in the project folder and open http://localhost:3000 in the browser, you should see the application running.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
